h2. How many bottles of beer on the wall?

Beer Totaller tracks thanks (in the form of beers), as queued up by the "Numbr5 Bot":http://github.com/freelancing-god/numbr5 in IRC.

This initial release is severely limited. Patches are very much welcome. Hopefully it'll see some significant improvement at "Rails Camp 6":http://railscamps.com#au_november_2009 in Melbourne.

This is not a unique idea. There are other very similar implementations. But I wanted to write it... if it gets used, that's just a bonus.
